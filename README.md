Hi. This is a todo app for you, if you are a terminal guy.
</br>Be happy cause you don't need to go out of terminal and write down your todo list in any other apps. 

Now you can use it with:

# Show all todos
```todo```

# Add a new todo
```todo add "Buy groceries"```
```todo add "Finish project"```

# Check/uncheck a todo (toggle)
```todo check 1```

# Remove a todo
```todo remove 2```

# Clear all completed todos
```todo clear```

# Show help
```todo help```
